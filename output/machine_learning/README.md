[Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/)  
by David J.C. MacKay  
"This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a first- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks."

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)  
by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani  
"This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist."

[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)  
by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman  
"During the past decade has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book."

[Diving into Machine Learning through TensorFlow - PyCon 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZBIPwdGtkk)  
by Julia Ferraioli, Amy Unruh, Eli Bixby  
"Machine learning can be an intimidating subject. In this session, we’ll get practical, hands-on experience with core concepts in machine learning with TensorFlow, an open source deep learning library. We’ll introduce the basics of TensorFlow, including how to ingest and prepare raw data for use, run a variety of algorithms to gain insight from the data, and have some fun with visualization."

[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)  
by Andrew Ng, Stanford University  
"This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas."  
  
[Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://class.coursera.org/pgm/lecture/preview)  
by Daphne Koller, Stanford University  
"In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems."  Sign up for a previous offering of the course.

[Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark](https://www.edx.org/course/distributed-machine-learning-apache-uc-berkeleyx-cs120x)  
by Ameet Talwalkar, UCLA and Jon Bates, Databricks  
"This statistics and data analysis course introduces the underlying statistical and algorithmic principles required to develop scalable real-world machine learning pipelines. We present an integrated view of data processing by highlighting the various components of these pipelines, including exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, supervised learning, and model evaluation. You will gain hands-on experience applying these principles using Spark, a cluster computing system well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks, and its packages spark.ml and spark.mllib. You will implement distributed algorithms for fundamental statistical models (linear regression, logistic regression, principal component analysis) while tackling key problems from domains such as online advertising and cognitive neuroscience."
