[Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)  
by Allen Downey  
"Think Python is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters." Uses Python 3.

[Think Stats 2e](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)  
by Allen Downey  
"Think Stats is an introduction to Probability and Statistics for Python programmers. Think Stats emphasizes simple techniques you can use to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. The book presents a case study using data from the National Institutes of Health. Readers are encouraged to work on a project with real datasets. If you have basic skills in Python, you can use them to learn concepts in probability and statistics. Think Stats is based on a Python library for probability distributions (PMFs and CDFs). Many of the exercises use short programs to run experiments and help readers develop understanding."

[Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/)  
by Allen Downey  
"Think Bayes is an introduction to Bayesian statistics using computational methods. Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead of math, and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics. As a result, what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops."

[Computational and Inferential Thinking](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/)  
by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero  
"Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation. There are three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference. This text develops a consistent approach to all three, introducing statistical ideas and fundamental ideas in computer science concurrently. We focus on a minimal set of core techniques that they apply to a vast range of real-world applications. A foundation in data science requires not only understanding statistical and computational techniques, but also recognizing how they apply to real scenarios." Uses Python 3.

[Statistics for Hackers - PyCon 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5GVOFAYi8k)  
by Jake Vanderplas  
"Statistics has the reputation of being difficult to understand, but using some simple Python skills it can be made much more intuitive. This talk will cover several sampling-based approaches to solving statistical problems, and show you that if you can write a for-loop, you can do statistics."
