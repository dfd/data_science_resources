[Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)  
by Robert I. Kabacoff  
"R is an elegant and comprehensive statistical and graphical programming language. Unfortunately, it can also have a steep learning curve. I created this website for both current R users, and experienced users of other statistical packages (e.g., SAS, SPSS, Stata) who would like to transition to R. My goal is to help you quickly access this language in your work."  See <a href='http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/index.html'>Basic Graphs</a> and <a href='http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/index.html'>Advanced Graphs</a> for visualization examples.

[Exploring Seaborn and Pandas based plot types in HoloViews](http://philippjfr.com/blog/seabornviews/)  
by Philipp Rudiger  
"In this notebook we'll look at interfacing between the composability and ability to generate complex visualizations that HoloViews provides and the great looking plots incorporated in the seaborn library. Along the way we'll explore how to wrap different types of data in a number of Seaborn View types, including: Distribution Views, Bivariate Views, TimeSeries Views"

[Lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html)  
"A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics needs, and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard requirements. See ?Lattice for an introduction."  
Other tags: [R Packages](../programming#RPackages)   
  
[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/)  
"ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics, which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and none of the bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics."
