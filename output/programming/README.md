[Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)  
by Allen Downey  
"Think Python is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters." Uses Python 3.

[The Foundations of Data Science](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ds8/textbook/details)  
by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero  
"Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation. There are three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference. This text develops a consistent approach to all three, introducing statistical ideas and fundamental ideas in computer science concurrently. We focus on a minimal set of core techniques that they apply to a vast range of real-world applications. A foundation in data science requires not only understanding statistical and computational techniques, but also recognizing how they apply to real scenarios." Uses Python 3.

[Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)  
by Cosma Rohilla Shalizi  
"This book began as the notes for 36-402, Advanced Data Analysis, at Carnegie Mellon University... ADA is a class in statistical methodology: its aim is to get students to understand something of the range of modern methods of data analysis, and of the considerations which go into choosing the right method for the job at hand (rather than distorting the problem to fit the methods you happen to know). Statistical theory is kept to a minimum, and largely introduced as needed. Since ADA is also a class in data analysis, there are a lot of assignments in which large, real data sets are analyzed with the new methods."

[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)  
by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman  
"During the past decade has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book."

[Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)  
by Cam Davidson-Pilon  
"Bayesian Methods for Hackers is designed as an introduction to Bayesian inference from a computational/understanding-first, and mathematics-second, point of view. Of course as an introductory book, we can only leave it at that: an introductory book. For the mathematically trained, they may cure the curiosity this text generates with other texts designed with mathematical analysis in mind. For the enthusiast with less mathematical-background, or one who is not interested in the mathematics but simply the practice of Bayesian methods, this text should be sufficient and entertaining."

[Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)  
by Hadley Wickham  
"A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores."

[spaCy](https://spacy.io/)  
"spaCy helps you write programs that do clever things with text. You give it a string of characters, it gives you an object that provides multiple useful views of its meaning and linguistic structure. Specifically, spaCy features a high performance tokenizer, part-of-speech tagger, named entity recognizer and syntactic dependency parser, with built-in support for word vectors. All of the functionality is united behind a clean high-level Python API, that makes it easy to use the different annotations together."

[Simple CV](http://simplecv.org/)  
"SimpleCV is an open source framework for building computer vision applications. With it, you get access to several high-powered computer vision libraries such as OpenCV â without having to first learn about bit depths, file formats, color spaces, buffer management, eigenvalues, or matrix versus bitmap storage. This is computer vision made easy."
