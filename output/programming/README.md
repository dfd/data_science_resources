[Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)  
by Allen Downey  
"Think Python is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters." Uses Python 3.

[Computational and Inferential Thinking](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/)  
by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero  
"Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation. There are three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference. This text develops a consistent approach to all three, introducing statistical ideas and fundamental ideas in computer science concurrently. We focus on a minimal set of core techniques that they apply to a vast range of real-world applications. A foundation in data science requires not only understanding statistical and computational techniques, but also recognizing how they apply to real scenarios." Uses Python 3.

[Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)  
by Cosma Rohilla Shalizi  
"This book began as the notes for 36-402, Advanced Data Analysis, at Carnegie Mellon University... ADA is a class in statistical methodology: its aim is to get students to understand something of the range of modern methods of data analysis, and of the considerations which go into choosing the right method for the job at hand (rather than distorting the problem to fit the methods you happen to know). Statistical theory is kept to a minimum, and largely introduced as needed. Since ADA is also a class in data analysis, there are a lot of assignments in which large, real data sets are analyzed with the new methods."

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)

[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)  
by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman  
"During the past decade has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book."

[Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)  
by Cam Davidson-Pilon  
"Bayesian Methods for Hackers is designed as an introduction to Bayesian inference from a computational/understanding-first, and mathematics-second, point of view. Of course as an introductory book, we can only leave it at that: an introductory book. For the mathematically trained, they may cure the curiosity this text generates with other texts designed with mathematical analysis in mind. For the enthusiast with less mathematical-background, or one who is not interested in the mathematics but simply the practice of Bayesian methods, this text should be sufficient and entertaining."

by Sebastian Raschka  
"When we are applying machine learning algorithms to real-world applications, our computer hardware often still constitutes the major bottleneck of the learning process. Of course, we all have access to supercomputers, Amazon EC2, Apache Spark, etc. However, out-of-core learning via Stochastic Gradient Descent can still be attractive if we'd want to update our model on-the-fly ('online-learning'), and in this notebook, I want to provide some examples of how we can implement an 'out-of-core' approach using scikit-learn. I compiled the following code examples for personal reference, and I don't intend it to be a comprehensive reference for the underlying theory, but nonetheless, I decided to share it since it may be useful to one or the other!"

[Classifier calibration with Platt's scaling and isotonic regression](http://fastml.com/classifier-calibration-with-platts-scaling-and-isotonic-regression/)  
by Zygmunt Zając  
"Calibration is applicable in case a classifier outputs probabilities. Apparently some classifiers have their typical quirks - for example, they say boosted trees and SVM tend to predict probabilities conservatively, meaning closer to mid-range than to extremes. If your metric cares about exact probabilities, like logarithmic loss does, you can calibrate the classifier, that is post-process the predictions to get better estimates."

[Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)  
by   
"A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores."  
  
[GAM: The Predictive Modeling Silver Bullet](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/07/30/gam/)  
by Kim Larsen  
"Despite its lack of popularity in the data science community, GAM is a powerful and yet simple technique. Hence, the purpose of this post is to convince more data scientists to use GAM. Of course, GAM is no silver bullet, but it is a technique you should add to your arsenal. Here are three key reasons: Easy to interpret; Flexible predictor functions can uncover hidden patterns in the data; Regularization of predictor functions helps avoid overfitting."

[Hierarchical Partial Pooling for Repeated Binary Trials](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html)  
by Bob Carpenter, Jonah Gabry and Ben Goodrich  
"This vignette illustrates the effects on posterior inference of pooling data (a.k.a sharing strength) across units for repeated binary trial data. It provides R code to fit and check predictive models for three situations: (a) complete pooling, which assumes each unit is the same, (b) no pooling, which assumes the units are unrelated, and (c) partial pooling, where the similarity among the units is estimated. The note explains with working examples how to (i) fit the models using rstanarm and plot the results, (ii) estimate event probabilities, (iii) evaluate posterior predictive densities to evaluate model predictions on held-out data, (iv) rank units by chance of success, (v) perform multiple comparisons in several settings, (vi) replicate new data for posterior pp-values, and (vii) perform graphical posterior predictive checks."
