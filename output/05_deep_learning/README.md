[Diving into Machine Learning through TensorFlow - PyCon 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZBIPwdGtkk)  
by Julia Ferraioli, Amy Unruh, Eli Bixby  
"Machine learning can be an intimidating subject. In this session, we'll get practical, hands-on experience with core concepts in machine learning with TensorFlow, an open source deep learning library. We’ll introduce the basics of TensorFlow, including how to ingest and prepare raw data for use, run a variety of algorithms to gain insight from the data, and have some fun with visualization."

[Introduction to Scikit Flow](http://terrytangyuan.github.io/2016/03/14/scikit-flow-intro/)  
by Yuan Tang  
"Scikit Flow is a simplified interface for TensorFlow, to get people started on predictive analytics and data mining. It helps smooth the transition from the Scikit-learn world of one-liner machine learning into the more open world of building different shapes of ML models. You can start by using fit/predict and slide into TensorFlow APIs as you are getting comfortable. It’s Scikit-learn compatible so you can also benefit from Scikit-learn features like GridSearch and Pipeline."

## <a name="DeepLearningCourses"></a>Deep Learning Courses  

[Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks)  
by Geoffrey Hinton  
"Learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well.<br>This course contains the same content presented on Coursera beginning in 2013. It is not a continuation or update of the original course. It has been adapted for the new platform.<br>Please be advised that the course is suited for an intermediate level learner - comfortable with calculus and with experience programming (Python)."  
  
[Deep Learning Learning Path from Big Data University](https://bigdatauniversity.com/learn/deep-learning/)  
by IBM  
"In this learning path, you will be able to learn the basic concepts of Neural Networks, Deep Leaning and TensorFlow. Then, you will get hands-on experience in solving problems using Deep Learning. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders."

[Learning Machines 101](http://www.learningmachines101.com/)  
by Richard M. Golden  
The intended audience for this podcast series is the general public and the intended objective of this podcast series is to help popularize and demystify the field of Artificial Intelligence by explaining fundamental concepts in an entertaining manner. However, many advanced topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning will be discussed at a “high-level” so students, scientists, and engineers working in the machine learning area may find this podcast series beneficial for identifying relevant “entry points” into advanced statistical machine learning topics. Relevant references to advanced readings are provided (when applicable) in the show notes for each episode.

## <a name="DeepLearningPackages"></a>Deep Learning Packages  

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  
"TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization. The system is designed to facilitate research in machine learning, and to make it quick and easy to transition from research prototype to production system."  
Other tags: [Python Packages](../02_programming#PythonPackages)   
  
[Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)  
"Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently."  
Other tags: [Python Packages](../02_programming#PythonPackages)   
  
[Keras](http://keras.io/)  
"Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research."

[The Neural Network Zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/)  
by Fjodor Van Veen  
"With new neural network architectures popping up every now and then, it’s hard to keep track of them all. Knowing all the abbreviations being thrown around (DCIGN, BiLSTM, DCGAN, anyone?) can be a bit overwhelming at first.<br>So I decided to compose a cheat sheet containing many of those architectures. Most of these are neural networks, some are completely different beasts. Though all of these architectures are presented as novel and unique, when I drew the node structures… their underlying relations started to make more sense."  
  
[Yes you should understand backprop](https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b#.deo6y636u)  
by Andrej Karpathy  
"In other words, it is easy to fall into the trap of abstracting away the learning process — believing that you can simply stack arbitrary layers together and backprop will “magically make them work” on your data. So lets look at a few explicit examples where this is not the case in quite unintuitive ways."
