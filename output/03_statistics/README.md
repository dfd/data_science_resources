[Think Stats 2e](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)  
by Allen Downey  
"Think Stats is an introduction to Probability and Statistics for Python programmers. Think Stats emphasizes simple techniques you can use to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. The book presents a case study using data from the National Institutes of Health. Readers are encouraged to work on a project with real datasets. If you have basic skills in Python, you can use them to learn concepts in probability and statistics. Think Stats is based on a Python library for probability distributions (PMFs and CDFs). Many of the exercises use short programs to run experiments and help readers develop understanding."

[Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/)  
by Allen Downey  
"Think Bayes is an introduction to Bayesian statistics using computational methods. Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead of math, and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics. As a result, what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops."

[A First Course in Design and Analysis of Experiments](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~gary/book/fcdae.pdf)  
by Gary W. Oehlert  
"This text covers the basic topics in experimental design and analysis and is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. Students should have had an introductory statistical methods course at about the level of Moore and McCabe's Introduction to the Practice of Statistics (Moore and McCabe 1999) and be familiar with t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, and the basics of regression and ANOVA."  
  
[Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/)  
by David J.C. MacKay  
"This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a first- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks."

[Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Online)  
by David Barber  
"The book is designed to appeal to students with only a modest mathematical background in undergraduate calculus and linear algebra. No formal computer science or statistical background is required to follow the book, although a basic familiarity with probability, calculus and linear algebra would be useful. The book should appeal to students from a variety of backgrounds, including Computer Science, Engineering, applied Statistics, Physics, and Bioinformatics that wish to gain an entry to probabilistic approaches in Machine Learning. In order to engage with students, the book introduces fundamental concepts in inference using only minimal reference to algebra and calculus. More mathematical techniques are postponed until as and when required, always with the concept as primary and the mathematics secondary."

[Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)  
by Cosma Rohilla Shalizi  
"This book began as the notes for 36-402, Advanced Data Analysis, at Carnegie Mellon University... ADA is a class in statistical methodology: its aim is to get students to understand something of the range of modern methods of data analysis, and of the considerations which go into choosing the right method for the job at hand (rather than distorting the problem to fit the methods you happen to know). Statistical theory is kept to a minimum, and largely introduced as needed. Since ADA is also a class in data analysis, there are a lot of assignments in which large, real data sets are analyzed with the new methods."

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)  
by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani  
"This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist."

[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)  
by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman  
"During the past decade has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book."

[Probabilistic Models in the Study of Language](http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~rlevy/pmsl_textbook/text.html)  
by Roger Levy  
"I'm in the process of writing a textbook on the topic of using probabilistic models in scientific work on language ranging from experimental data analysis to corpus work to cognitive modeling. The intended audience is graduate students in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, and computer science who are interested in using probabilistic models to study language."

[Computational and Inferential Thinking](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/)  
by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero  
"Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation. There are three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference. This text develops a consistent approach to all three, introducing statistical ideas and fundamental ideas in computer science concurrently. We focus on a minimal set of core techniques that they apply to a vast range of real-world applications. A foundation in data science requires not only understanding statistical and computational techniques, but also recognizing how they apply to real scenarios." Uses Python 3.

[Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)  
by Cam Davidson-Pilon  
"Bayesian Methods for Hackers is designed as an introduction to Bayesian inference from a computational/understanding-first, and mathematics-second, point of view. Of course as an introductory book, we can only leave it at that: an introductory book. For the mathematically trained, they may cure the curiosity this text generates with other texts designed with mathematical analysis in mind. For the enthusiast with less mathematical-background, or one who is not interested in the mathematics but simply the practice of Bayesian methods, this text should be sufficient and entertaining."

"Despite its lack of popularity in the data science community, GAM is a powerful and yet simple technique. Hence, the purpose of this post is to convince more data scientists to use GAM. Of course, GAM is no silver bullet, but it is a technique you should add to your arsenal. Here are three key reasons: Easy to interpret; Flexible predictor functions can uncover hidden patterns in the data; Regularization of predictor functions helps avoid overfitting."

[Hierarchical Partial Pooling for Repeated Binary Trials](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html)  
by Bob Carpenter, Jonah Gabry and Ben Goodrich  
"This vignette illustrates the effects on posterior inference of pooling data (a.k.a sharing strength) across units for repeated binary trial data. It provides R code to fit and check predictive models for three situations: (a) complete pooling, which assumes each unit is the same, (b) no pooling, which assumes the units are unrelated, and (c) partial pooling, where the similarity among the units is estimated. The note explains with working examples how to (i) fit the models using rstanarm and plot the results, (ii) estimate event probabilities, (iii) evaluate posterior predictive densities to evaluate model predictions on held-out data, (iv) rank units by chance of success, (v) perform multiple comparisons in several settings, (vi) replicate new data for posterior pp-values, and (vii) perform graphical posterior predictive checks."

[Beyond Power Calculations: Assessing Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) Errors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower_final.pdf)  
by Andrew Gelman1 and John Carlin  
"Statistical power analysis provides the conventional approach to assess error rates when designing a research study. However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information."

The advice is organized into three general areas:<br>Technical: Ideas and techniques for how to manipulate and examine your data.<br>Process: Recommendations on how you approach your data, what questions to ask, and what things to check.<br>Social: How to work with others and communicate about your data and insights."
