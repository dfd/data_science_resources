[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction ](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html)  
by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto  
"The book consists of three parts. Part I is introductory and problem oriented. We focus on the simplest aspects of reinforcement learning and on its main distinguishing features. One full chapter is devoted to introducing the reinforcement learning problem whose solution we explore in the rest of the book. Part II presents what we see as the three most important elementary solution methods: dynamic programming, simple Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. The first of these is a planning method and assumes explicit knowledge of all aspects of a problem, whereas the other two are learning methods. Part III is concerned with generalizing these methods and blending them. Eligibility traces allow unification of Monte Carlo and temporal-difference methods, and function approximation methods such as artificial neural networks extend all the methods so that they can be applied to much larger problems. We bring planning and learning methods together again and relate them to heuristic search. Finally, we summarize our view of the state of reinforcement learning research and briefly present case studies, including some of the most impressive applications of reinforcement learning to date."

[Learning Machines 101](http://www.learningmachines101.com/)  
by Richard M. Golden  
The intended audience for this podcast series is the general public and the intended objective of this podcast series is to help popularize and demystify the field of Artificial Intelligence by explaining fundamental concepts in an entertaining manner. However, many advanced topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning will be discussed at a “high-level” so students, scientists, and engineers working in the machine learning area may find this podcast series beneficial for identifying relevant “entry points” into advanced statistical machine learning topics. Relevant references to advanced readings are provided (when applicable) in the show notes for each episode.

[gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs)  
"OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent, and is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano. You can use it from Python code, and soon from other languages."
